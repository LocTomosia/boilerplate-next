# constants

This file defines common constants.

- For environment-dependent variables (such as API keys), consider using
  [config](../../config).
- If there are some type definitions that depend on constants, you can export
  them from this folder.
- Conversely, for type definitions that do not depend on constants, use
  [types](../types).
