# pages

This is the directory for page components.
To allow coexistence with Storybook files (\*.stories.tsx), page component file extensions are named .pages.tsx.

#Route

When adding new pages, make sure to update the path and page title in features/routing.ts.

Static routes → StaticRoutes

Dynamic routes → DynamicRoutes
For page titles, even for dynamic routes, use a unique and consistent value.
